## Atlas Shrugged Part 1 Recap

Who is John Galt?

I started Atlas Shrugged over the new year and finished through Part 1, "Non-Contradiction". I took a break from Atlas Shrugged to read The Fountainhead since I've heard from a few people like Michael Malice and Yaron Brook that it's most effective to read Fountainhead first. This post is for my own benefit, and it will be the sparknotes of part 1 so I can hop back in and start part 2.

### Plot Summary
Dagny Taggart is the effective president of Taggart Transcontinental, a failing rail line. Hank Rearden has discovered a new type of steel that is much stronger and lighter than normal. While most rail lines are afraid to be the first to try this new steel, Dagny is inspired by Hank's entrepreneurial spirit and integrity. Not only does she want to use Rearden Metal for a new rail line, but she must. Her normal suppliers of rails have failed to fulfill her order, stating "we can't be blamed" when their own suppliers fall through. 

This theme appears early on with many CEOs and workers failing to take responsibility for their products. Everyone is a victim of circumstance and happy to let you know. Another prevalent theme introduced here is the need for public approval or public service. The elites and intellectuals profess the social responsibility of companies to serve the public, even when it goes against strict business incentives. The Anti-Dog-Eat-Dog pact that the railroad council enacts further ties the hands of these railroad execs. Early in the story we have already met distasteful figures like Dagny's brother who seem to be taking the world down with them. 

At some point, we meet Francisco D'Anconia. There is a childhood vignette showing Dagny's loyalty to Francisco because of his integrity and extreme competence. However, in the present day he seems to have become one of these hated intellectuals who will do anything for the "public". It's unclear why he changed, but his purposely failed venture into railroads in Mexico sank many people's money, including T.T.'s, into the government of Mexico's hands. 

After some more development, we come to the point where Dagny's and TT's future lies in the hand of Hank Rearden. She bets the company on a new rail line fully utilizing Rearden Metal tracks and a Rearden Metal bridge. While she scrambles to create new engines, rails, beams, and other, she encounters the strange phenomenon that all the hardworking men of integrity that she trusts in the rail industry are falling off the map. It seems that there is a mysterious force that is making them retire. The implication is that this force is negative, perhaps the government hunting down those who would help Dagny, but the alternative is something I think I know but shouldn't.
