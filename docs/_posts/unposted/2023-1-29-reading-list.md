This is sort of a mega post with a few ideas. It might act as a persistant storage of lists, ideas, plans, or it might not.

I will try and learn from my previous posts not to make any promises of posting regularly. I leave up my first post since it's almost comical how much I expected myself to wite and how little I did - it's been 1.5 years since my last one.

Last year I set a reading goal of 52 books. This goal was to jump-start my reading habit and keep me focused on reading about one book per week. I was disciplined enough to not spring for short books which would help my stats until the end of the year when I had only 3 books left and 4 days to do it. Unfortunatly I did not officially hit my goal, but after looking back at my list, it's possible I forgot to track a few titles that would have put me over 52.

## Looking backward to 2022
I learned a few lessons by reading (almost) 52 books last year.

1. Reading a book you aren't excited about will slow you down
2. I tend to start many and finish few, leading to a scattered brain and more stress
3. It's impossible to read this much without a solid habit

There are a few books I remember slogging through which hurt my progress and reading habit. *Infinite Jest* has been a recurring issue - I keep thinking I have the will to finish it but new and shiny books jump out and distract me. In addition, *Free to Choose* was a tough one. I don't think I actually finished it. *Dante's Inferno* was a bit too literary for me. I realize now that even if I did consume it, I wouldn't have gotten much out of it. For books like that, I need background before diving in. For that reason, it's lucky that my Aunt gifted me *The Western Cannon* by Harold Bloom, which should give background for a few books on my shelf, including *Don Quixote*.


## To take notes or not
I've been influenced by a few "how to read better" posts before, by Tim Ferris and by fs.blog. The Tim Ferris method involves keeping a self-made index in the front of the book, pointing to quotations, concepts, and actionable ideas you find in the book. The idea is to generate this index of big ideas for quick retrieval and pruning later. I find that I ended up just writing down quotations. This method did not lead me to any big insights. 

The methods in fs.blog include the Feynmann technique of 'mind mapping' on a blank sheet of paper everything you know about a topic, adding to this as you read. I didn't find that especially helpful either.

I think my takeaways are these: I will allow myself to keep short note entries in fiction books that I read so that I can refer back to them when I write a blog post. When I read non-fiction, I will experiment with more involved note-taking techniques - I understand how important it is to spend time learning only that which you want to remember, so you must remember all that you want to learn. Learning how to take notes (and remember) is a lifelong process so I'll (re)start now. 


## Reading to tune thinking
How does reading change the way you think? Does the method of reading - speed vs subvocalizing - change this? Does speed reading cause your internal monologue to become speedy itself? Does this impair your ability to write?

## Writing to tune thinking
I've read before on the importance of writing in improving one's ability to reason and think. Perhaps writing blog posts regularly in which I try and convey an idea, argue a position, or summarize knowledge, would generally be helpful in practicing communication and thinking skills. Jordan Peterson believes that a person would do well to become an articulate communicator, since it takes effective communication to get one's ideas out there. My blog posts should demonstrate how my thinking has changes (and hopefully improved) over time.

## Books vs Podcasts
This idea might deserve its own blog post. I've recently become more in favor of listening to audiobooks instead of podcasts. While podcasts are entertaining and can be educational when figures from recent discoveries are interviewed, they typically don't stand the test of time and aren't as highly curated as books over the years.

## Looking forward to 2023
My goal in 2023 is to continue an upward trend in all aspects that matter to me. I'll continue writing about this over time.

# Textbook Reading List
This is an ordered list of the textbooks I'm interested in reading. The order can be changed! But there is an order. This is to prevent me from attempting to read multiple at the same time.
