Context: I read Milton Friedman's "Capitalism and Freedom" after listening to the entirety of his lecture series from the late 1970s. These lectures spoke and put words to my understandings of the world that had not yet solidified. With a logical method of analysing economic policy, especially those of America since the Great Depression as case studies, the mysteries of social and economic effects can be understood and predicted. Some exemplary points that Milton makes which are not widely understood:
- government is made up of people, most usefully understood as political profit maximizers
- corporations are made up of people, most usefully understood as profit maximizers
- actions taken against corporations do not just affect the corporation -- the effect is on the people employed by the corporation, the people who sell products to the corporation, and the people who buy products from the corporation
- virtuous intentions of a governmental policy do not change the outcome based on incentives it creates

Capitalism and Freedom will give you pretty much the same information as the lecture series, though you miss out on some of Milton's rhetoric in the entertaining Q&A that always followed. 

## Summary
Liberal values play a major role in this book. The importance of competition in a free enterprise system is argued throughout. It is argued early on that a society that strives for equality before liberty will have neither, but a society that strives for liberty will have both liberty and a likelihood of greater equality. The role of government in a person's life is understood using liberal principles in many cases - monopolies, education, medical certification, taxes and tarrifs. The book describes the three bad choices of monopoly - technological, governmental, and cartel - and weighs these evils against eachother by applying liberal values. In education, it is argued that state-funded and implemented education leads to poor outputs and social stratification by limiting options of the unfortunate. An education voucher system is presented that would lead to greater competition and more opportunities for all economic classes to be schooled. The case study of medical certification as a government-enforced monopoly is explored. The monetary policy that Milton argues lead to the Great Depression is described. 

## Discussion
I find it hard to see how anyone could argue with the contents of this book from an economic standpoint. Milton uses basic economic theory to back up his views. I believe that less-educated arguers tend to ignore second-order economic effects of their pet policies and instead take them at face value, which tends to be the rhetoric that politicians use to sell their bills. When Milton exposes these policies to the rigor of economics and expose their shortcomings, people see Milton as a conservative, neo-liberal, guy-who-doesn't-like-social-security-because-he's-selfish. 

One of the most fascinating things is that Milton's intellectual father is Adam Smith. It's funny that by applying Smith's principles today you can understand rather fully our economy, even though people try to complicate things with modern monetary theory and whatnot. 

This is not a very fleshed-out book review or discussion but hey, it's my first in a while and I read the book a few months ago. The gist of it is that I apprecate Milton's views, both economically and politically, and will be reading "Free to Choose" sometime soon.
